# GetServerStats
Java plugin for Minecraft server that saves server statistics to a JSON file

Data is being refreshed every 15 seconds in the JSON file.
Currently saves data for "mc_server_status", "player_count" and "player_list".
(this is only one of my few plugins)

05.09.2021 Update: now also saving last 50 messages of server chat into a seperate JSON file (ChatSaver.java).
